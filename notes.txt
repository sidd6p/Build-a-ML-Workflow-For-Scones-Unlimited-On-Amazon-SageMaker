AWS Sagemaker
SageMaker provides a complete set of tools for every step of the machine learning process, from data labeling and preparation to model training and deployment, making it easier to develop and deploy machine learning models in production environments.


Data Staging
Data staging involves collecting, preparing, and organizing the data that will be used to train and test machine learning models. 


This notebook has been tested on the Python 3 (Data Science) kernel with the ml.t3.medium instance ? 


CIFAR-100
The CIFAR-100 dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks in the field of machine learning and computer vision. 
It is an extension of the CIFAR-10 dataset and contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 100 different classes. 
Each class contains 600 images.


Pickle
Pickle is a module in Python that is primarily used to serialize and de-serialize a Python object structure. Both pickling and unpickling become essential when we have to transfer Python objects from one system to another.


b'filenames'
In Python, the b prefix before a string indicates that the string is a bytes literal. Bytes literals are used to represent sequences of bytes, not text characters.
In the context of your output b'filenames', it means that the key 'filenames' is represented as a bytes object. When working with data from certain sources, such as reading data from files, Python may represent strings as bytes objects to maintain the original binary data's integrity. 
This is common when dealing with binary data or data read from a network socket.


np.dstack()
np.dstack() is a NumPy function that stacks arrays along the third axis. 
Specifically, it stacks arrays along the depth dimension, creating a new array.
